# Network

## IP changing constantly on PCs

Path for setting the connection properties manually on Windows 10: `Painel de Controle\Rede e Internet\Central de Rede e Compartilhamento\Change Adapter Settings\Right Click\Properties\Click Ipv4\Properties Again`

On my tower using ethernet cable everything is correct and fully working \(Spotify, Reddit, apps that usually use Ipv4 protocol\) and with the following configuration, it's set up for DHCP :

On my laptop the current settings are \(everything Ipv4 related working properly\):

I took a printscreen before when the PC came back from hibernation and no IPv4 address was shown, therefore what showed up was:

See that actually what is written is: IPv4 address of automatic configuration, i don't know if this is related to DHCP or not, i will check that later.
